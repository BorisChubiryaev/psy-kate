# Vercel Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Psy-Kate website for deployment on Vercel as a static site.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates

- Simplified scripts to only include frontend development and build commands
- Removed server dependencies (express, drizzle-orm, etc.)
- Removed server devDependencies (tsx, esbuild, etc.)
- Kept only frontend-related dependencies

### 2. Vite Configuration

- Removed server-specific plugins
- Simplified build output directory to standard `dist` folder
- Removed references to deleted directories

### 3. Removed Unnecessary Directories

- Deleted entire `server/` directory (not needed for static deployment)
- Deleted `shared/` directory (only used for server-side functionality)
- Removed `drizzle.config.ts` (database configuration not needed for static site)

### 4. Configuration Updates

- Updated `tsconfig.json` to remove references to deleted directories
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to remove alias references to deleted directories
- Created `vercel.json` with proper routing and security headers

### 5. Documentation

- Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with Vercel-specific deployment instructions

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel using one of these methods:
   - Vercel CLI: `vercel`
   - Git integration: Connect your repository to Vercel
   - Manual deployment: `vercel dist`

## What Was Removed

The following components were removed as they are not needed for a static website deployment:

- Backend server code (Express.js)
- Database integration (Drizzle ORM)
- Server-side routing
- Session management
- API endpoints
- Server-specific build processes

## What Remains

The following components are still included and functional:

- React frontend with all UI components
- Liquid glass design implementation
- Client-side routing with wouter
- All static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript)
- Responsive design for all device sizes

The website is now ready for deployment as a static site on Vercel.
